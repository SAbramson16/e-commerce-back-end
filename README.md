# e-commerce-back-end

## Description
This application is an e-commerce back end. It holds a database of an internet retail company.

## Installation

The db folder holds the database schema. The models folder holds files for each model that sets up the fields and rules for the Category, Tag, Product and ProductTag model, as well as their associations. The routes folder holds the code for the api routes and routers. The seeds folder holds the seed files for seeding the database. To install this application, the following dependencies must be installed: express, dotenv, mysql2, and sequelize.  

## Usage
Once the dependencies are installed and the proper files are sourced and seeded, the application will launch after entering "npm start" into the command line of the terminal. The applications routes will be tested in Insomnia. A video demonstration of the routes being tested is included.
